 * This class servers as the View for my Class.
 * The view is how we would normally display information via a GUI. Since there's no GUI for this project, the View simply treats the console as the GUI and presents information by printing the info to the console.
 * The goal is to be able to use the console as a GUI for my Class model, which means I should see the information associated with my view printed to the GUI (console).
