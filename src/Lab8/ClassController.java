/**
 * This class serves as the controller between my class model and view.
 * It's the mediator between my model and view, so it has access to both of them.
 * 
 * HINT: Remember, we don't want to do error checking in the view since that's our true frontend, which will be slowed down if
 * it also has to do the error checking. We also don't do the error checking in the Models since we don't do in-method error checking
 * with true backend code when using design by contract. SO, if the error checking isn't done in the view, and it's not done in my 
 * model, where would I do my in-method error checking...?
